## 🔧 Analysis Development

### Creating Analysis Files
```sql
-- Example: customer_lifetime_value_analysis.sql
{{ config(materialized='ephemeral') }}

WITH customer_metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        customer_type,
        COUNT(subscription_id) as total_subscriptions,
        SUM(subscription_value) as total_revenue,
        MIN(start_date) as first_subscription,
        MAX(end_date) as last_subscription
    FROM {{ ref('slv_subscriptions') }}
    GROUP BY 1, 2
),

clv_calculation AS (
    SELECT 
        *,
        total_revenue / NULLIF(total_subscriptions, 0) as avg_subscription_value,
        DATE_DIFF('month', first_subscription, last_subscription) as customer_lifetime_months
    FROM customer_metrics
)

SELECT 
    customer_type,
    AVG(total_revenue) as avg_clv,
    MEDIAN(total_revenue) as median_clv,
    COUNT(*) as customer_count
FROM clv_calculation
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

### Execution Pattern
```bash
# Compile analysis (check syntax)
dbt compile --select analyses/

# Run specific analysis
dbt compile --select analyses/customer_lifetime_value_analysis

# Generate and view compiled SQL
cat target/compiled/drivesight/analyses/customer_lifetime_value_analysis.sql
```

- **Performance Testing**: Ensure queries execute efficiently

### Business Logic Validation
- **Business Rule Compliance**: Ensure analysis follows business rules
- **Metric Definitions**: Validate metric calculations and definitions
- **Segmentation Logic**: Verify customer and operational segmentation
- **Temporal Logic**: Validate time-based calculations and trends

## 📈 Common Analysis Patterns

### Customer Analytics
```sql
-- Customer segmentation analysis
WITH customer_segments AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        customer_type,
        subscription_count,
        total_revenue,
        CASE 
            WHEN total_revenue >= 10000 THEN 'High Value'
            WHEN total_revenue >= 5000 THEN 'Medium Value'
            ELSE 'Low Value'
        END as value_segment
    FROM customer_summary
)
SELECT value_segment, COUNT(*), AVG(total_revenue)
FROM customer_segments
GROUP BY 1
```

### Fleet Analytics
```sql
-- Fleet utilization analysis
WITH daily_fleet AS (
    SELECT 
        date,
        city,
        active_fleet_size,
        total_subscriptions,
        active_fleet_size / NULLIF(total_subscriptions, 0) as utilization_rate
    FROM fleet_daily_summary
)
SELECT 
    city,
    AVG(utilization_rate) as avg_utilization,
    MIN(utilization_rate) as min_utilization,
    MAX(utilization_rate) as max_utilization
FROM daily_fleet
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

### Operational Analytics
```sql
-- Delivery performance analysis
WITH delivery_metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        city,
        week,
        delivery_volume,
        LAG(delivery_volume) OVER (PARTITION BY city ORDER BY week) as prev_week_volume
    FROM weekly_delivery_summary
)
SELECT 
    city,
    AVG((delivery_volume - prev_week_volume) / NULLIF(prev_week_volume, 0)) as avg_growth_rate,
    COUNT(*) as weeks_analyzed
FROM delivery_metrics
WHERE prev_week_volume IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

## 🔄 Best Practices

### Development
- **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive file names that indicate analysis purpose
- **Documentation**: Include comments explaining analytical logic
- **Modularity**: Break complex analyses into logical components
- **Reusability**: Design analyses that can be easily modified for similar questions

### Execution
- **Performance**: Optimize queries for large datasets
- **Resource Management**: Consider resource usage for complex analyses
- **Validation**: Always validate results against business expectations
- **Documentation**: Record methodology and findings

### Collaboration
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Share analytical techniques and insights
- **Peer Review**: Review complex analyses with team members
- **Version Control**: Track analysis changes and iterations
- **Business Communication**: Translate technical findings into business insights

## 📊 Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Analyses
- **One-Time Questions**: Business questions that don't require ongoing monitoring
- **Exploratory Research**: Data exploration and hypothesis testing
- **Complex Calculations**: Analyses too complex for standard models
- **Validation Studies**: Data quality and business logic validation

### When to Create Models Instead
- **Recurring Needs**: Analysis needed regularly should become a model
- **Dashboard Requirements**: Data needed for dashboards should be modeled
- **Downstream Dependencies**: Data used by other models should be materialized
- **Performance Requirements**: Frequently accessed data should be pre-computed

### Migration Path
- **Prototype in Analyses**: Start with analysis file for exploration
- **Validate Business Value**: Confirm ongoing business need
- **Convert to Model**: Move valuable analyses to appropriate model layer
- **Optimize Performance**: Optimize materialization strategy for production use

## 🚨 Monitoring and Maintenance

### Analysis Health
- **Execution Success**: Monitor analysis compilation and execution
- **Performance**: Track analysis execution time and resource usage
- **Usage Patterns**: Understand which analyses are most valuable
- **Business Impact**: Assess business value of analytical insights

### Lifecycle Management
- **Regular Review**: Periodically review analysis inventory
- **Archive Unused**: Archive or remove unused analyses
- **Promote Valuable**: Convert valuable analyses to permanent models
- **Update Dependencies**: Ensure analyses work with model changes
